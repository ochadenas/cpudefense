"Your computer is being invaded by an evil virus. Rogue code fragments - shown as Ones and Zeroes - try to get through to the cpu.

Tap on the empty slot to add a chip as defense against the attack, and then tap again to confirm your choice.

The most basic chip is “SUB 1” which subtracts 1 from the attacker´s value. It turns 1´s into 0´s, and it makes 0´s disappear. Only then they are no longer a threat."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_2">
"You may also tap on an attacker. This will invert its value: 1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1.

Inverting a 0 will actually make the attacker more dangerous, so be careful not to tap on everything you see."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_3">
"The currency in this game is information. It is displayed on the bottom left.

Destroy the attacking code to gain some information about the virus. Use it to buy additional chips or to upgrade the existing ones."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_4">
"Here are some hints:

Remember that in binary,
  10 equals 2,
  11 equals 3,
100 equals 4,
and so on.

Try to tap on numbers starting with “1”. This reduces the attacker´s number and makes the level much easier.

Any attacker that gets through to the CPU will cost one life, regardless of its number. You must have at least one SUB chip to get rid of them."</string>
    <string name="instr_5">
"In the next level, a new chip type is available. It is labelled “SHR 1”, which means “shift right by 1”.

All digits are moved one position to the right. The leftmost digit is replaced by 0.

For example, 0110 becomes 0011. This is equivalent to dividing the value by 2."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_6">
"By clearing stages, you can gain cryptocoins. These coins are valuable. You can use them to hire some powerful Heroes of the Information Age who will give you significant advantages in the game.

There is a maximum amount of cryptocoins per level shown on the bottom, and each life lost will reduce the reward.

If you do not get all the coins, you can always replay the level. However, once you have obtained the maximum, you won´t receive any more coins for this stage.
"
    </string>
    <string name="instr_7">
"Sometimes you will see a cryptocoin moving along with the attackers. You can collect it by destroying it, even multiple times when you replay the level.

But be careful. The moving cryptocoin is stronger than ordinary attackers, and if it reaches the CPU, it will take one of your lives."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_7a">Chips need to cool down between operations. Hire heroes to reduce the chance of grouped attackers overwhelming a chip.\n\nIf you are stuck, you can replay a lower level trying to catch a running cryptocoin.</string>
    <string name="instr_8">"\nYou can sell existing chips and re-use their slot. Most, but not all of the information will be refunded.\n\nNote that an activated chip will complete its current cooldown cycle before disappearing."</string>
    <string name="instr_9">"\nLet´s introduce another chip. The MEM (for memory) chip takes a number and stores it safely away in memory. A little white indicator shows that there is a value inside.\n\nThe MEM chip must be “read out” (by tapping on it). Once you have tapped on the chip, its cool down cycle starts, and only after that the memory slot becomes available again. A thick white frame indicates whether you should tap on the chip.\n\nFor now, the MEM chip can hold only one attacker,. Later in the game you will be able to buy upgrades, creating additional slots.\n\nMEM chips are powerful because they can take out any attacker, but they require your attention, and they are quite slow."</string>
    <string name="instr_10">
"The accumulator chip (ACC) is a bit more complex than the others, but it can be very effective against large numbers of attackers. It takes two numbers and combines them into one result.

In its basic variant, it adds the two numbers. If you upgrade the chip once, it will OR the input numbers. Upgrading twice makes the operation an AND.

Example: If the numbers 0110 (that is 6) and 0011 (that is 3) enter the ACC chip, the result will be
1001 (that is 9) when adding [ACC +]
0111 (that is 7) using OR [ACC v]
0010 (that is 2) using AND [ACC &amp;].

The advantage of ACC is that it is really fast."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_11">
"Larger numbers are represented in hexadecimal. They are shown with a leading “x”.

In hex, you have digits from 0 to 9 and then from A to F. The hex number x0F equals 15, or 1111 in binary."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_12">
"Two more chip types: ADD and SHL.\n\nThese do the opposite of SUB and SHR, respectively: They add 1 to the number and shift the bits to the left.\n\nOf course, this is really undesired. You can “upgrade” these chips to reduce their strength or make them disappear."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_13">
"Note that cryptocoins are unaffected by ACC and also by MEM chips."
    </string>
    <string name="instr_14">Another chip becomes available! \n\nThe CLK (clock) chip does not affect the attackers itself. Instead, it speeds up the other chips on the board. Each time the CLK ticks, the cooldown timer of all other chips is reset, and they become ready to operate anew.\n\nUpgrading increases the CLK frequency.</string>
    <string name="instr_15">Overclocking the CPU can be dangerous: The faster your chips work, the hotter they will get.\n\nEach time your clock resets a chip, a small amount of heat is produced. Temperatures of more than %d degrees can damage the CPU, that means, that they can cost you one life.</string>
    <string name="instr_16">The NOP chip (No operation) does nothing. But since it occupies a slot, you might want to remove it.\n\nA NOP 2 chip also does nothing, but twice.</string>
    <string name="instr_17">Two more undesired chip types, then we have seen them all.\n\nDUP duplicates an attacking piece of code. Instead of one attacker, you\'ll have two, with the same number.\n\nSPLT (split) does nearly the same, but instead of simply duplicating the number, it splits it into two pieces. For example, xA4 becomes xA0 and x04. This is somewhat the opposite of ACC: If the two resulting numbers are combined by logical OR, you\'ll get the original values. </string>
    <string name="instr_18">Beware! Sneak attack!</string>
    <string name="instr_22">Remember that SHR chips are powerful but cannot eliminate attackers. They quickly reduce large values, but against hordes of weak attackers, multiple SUB chips may be a more cost-effective defence.</string>
    <string name="instr_23">Not all electronic components are logic chips. There are also important classic, analogue components such as capacitors [C] or resistors [R]. \n\nIn this game, resistors have the effect of slowing down the attackers for a certain period of time. Their strength is indicated by three coloured rings. The slowing effect is the bigger the stronger the attackers are. One-bit-numbers are hardly affected at all, whereas 8-bit numbers become quite slow by large resistances.\n\nResistors generate heat. There is a hero (Claude Shannon) who can convert some of this heat into information.</string>
    <string name="instr_endless">You have successfully cleared all stages and won the game!\n\nIf you want, you can continue in “endless” mode, with randomly generated circuits that get more and more difficult. You will start the “endless” series without heroes, and you cannot use the coins gathered until now. \n\nHow far will you get?</string>


    <string name="turing">Alan Turing was one of the most important persons in computer science. He created many of the foundations in theoretical computing, such as the Turing machine and the Turing test, and made important breakthroughs in cryptology. Building on the work of the Polish Cipher Bureau, he led the team that was responsible for deciphering the Enigma code during the Second World War. His impact on the outcome of the war can hardly be overestimated.\n\nHe was heavily discriminated against because of his homosexuality. He died, probably by his own hand, in 1954.\n</string>

"Ada, Countess of Lovelace is held to have invented the concept of Programming.

Together with Charles Babbage she worked on his mechanical calculation machine. She created an instruction set for the calculation of Bernoulli numbers, which is probably the first formal program ever written.

Lovelace realized that the abilities of a programmable engine were much greater than arithmetical computations. She also was the first to distinguish the symbolic concepts (software) from the physical parts (hardware).

She died in 1852, aged only 36."

Fortunately for the astronauts, however, the on-board computer was programmed by Margaret Hamilton and her team in such a way that it simply stopped performing less important tasks under stress. Thus it remained operational, and the “Eagle” landed safely on the moon.</item>
        <item>The development of storage capacity over a period of around 60 years is astonishing: a punch card (surface area approx. 156 cm²) has a storage capacity of 80 bytes. A standard microSD memory card today with a surface area of approx. 1.65 cm² and only slightly thicker has a capacity of 256 GB.\n\nThat is a ratio of approx. 1 : 300,000,000,000.\n\nHowever, the back of the punch card can be used to take notes, or write a shopping list. This is not possible with the memory card.</item>
        <item>The keyboard of an IBM 3270 terminal was so sturdy and heavy that some say that it could be used to beat stupid users to death with it.\n\nOthers claim that they have actually done so.</item>
        <item>In the ASCII character set, which we know today as ISO-8859, there are still reminders of its origins as a telegraph alphabet. For example, the ASCII code 07 (“BEL”) is used to ring a small bell on a teletypewriter.</item>
        <item>Long before the invention of the touchscreen, there was the light pen. This pen-shaped device was connected to the computer by a cable and could determine its position on the screen. To do this, it had a light-sensitive photocell at its tip.\n\nIn CRT monitors, the electron beam creates the image line by line. By measuring the exact time of the light flash perceived by the pen, the current position of the beam and thus also of the pen could be determined.\n\nThe light pen became obsolete by computer mice, and the principle does not work with modern flat screens anyway.</item>
        <item>In the 1990s, the programme “xsnow” was very popular on Unix computers. It made snowflakes gently fall down on the desktop background, building heaps on the top of the programme windows. From time to time the flakes were swirled by the wind, and sometimes you could see Santa Claus flying across the screen in a reindeer sleigh. The -showrudolph option determined whether the foremost reindeer had a red nose.</item>
        <item>Snacks are good in moderation.\n\n\n(“Tip of the day” in Civilization IV)</item>
        <item>To subtract one number from another in the binary system, you don\'t need to know how to subtract. Instead, you invert the number, add 1 and add the result.\n\nWhy does this work? If you invert a number - for example 0101 1110 (x5E) into 1010 0001 (xA1) - and add the two together, you always get 1111 1111 (i.e. xFF). Add 1 and discard the carry, this will yield 0000 0000. You can therefore interpret the number xA2 (i.e. xA1 plus 1) as “minus x5E”. Example: x7F - x5E is x21, and x7F + xA2 (shortened to 8 bits) is also x21.</item>
        <item>A “pizza box” is a flat computer housing shape with a square form. The term was coined in the 1990s for the SPARC workstations from Sun Microsystems with their elegant shapes that actually look like a pizza box.</item>
        <item>Douglas Engelbart is said to have invented the computer mouse. Although this is true, he was not the first. Almost exactly at the same time as Engelbart\'s first demo, the Telefunken company commercially launched a mouse with a roller ball. However, at a price of DM 1500, this was reserved for a few specialised users, such as universities.</item>
        <item>Probably the best-known chip of all times is the 7400 by Texas Instruments, which only contained four NAND gates. The 74xx series provides basic logic functions. It is not only extremely popular with hobbyists, but is also widely used in the commercial sector. The newer 74xx and 74xxx chips now contain highly complex circuits, but the oldest types still exist virtually unchanged.</item>
        <item>The first hackers in history were Louis Blanc and his twin brother François, who also developed modern roulette. The Blanc brothers used the Chappe telegraph to transmit information from the Paris stock exchange, which they used for insider trading and made considerable profits. They skilfully used a special character of the Chappe alphabet with the meaning “delete previous character” to hide their information in regular messages. They were convicted in 1836, but not sentenced as there was no law that they had broken.</item>
        <item>It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1685</item>
        <item>An “ultimate machine” has the only purpose to switch off itself. It is often realized as a box with a switch or a lever on it to activate the machine. This will make an arm come out of the box to switch the lever off again.\n\nA famous creator of Ultimate Machines was Claude Shannon together with his student Marvin Minsky. Other “useless machines” were designed already in the 1930s by Bruno Munari.</item>
        <item>Hewlett-Packard was one of the first companies to bring programmable pocket calculators onto the market. They used “Reverse Polish Notation”, which took some time getting used to at first, but allows quick and compact calculation instructions.\n\nHP calculators were also known for their solid and high-quality workmanship. Some of them are still in use today, and even some calculations for ChipDefense were carried out on an HP 11C (built in 1985).</item>
        <item>The earliest programmable pocket calculators were intended for use for serious engineering calculations, but also some games were published for them. For example, there was “Lunar Lander”.\n\nThe calculator would display the height and vertical speed of a lunar module, and the player had to enter the amount of fuel to be burned in the rockets. If you used too few, the lander would eventually crash into the surface; if you used too much, it would run out of fuel and also crash. In this case, the display showed the number 3507. Turned upside down, this reads LOSE.</item>
        <item>The Incas in South America used their very own way of storing and processing data. Their quipus consisted of a complex system of many threads and various knots that could be used to record numbers and even perform arithmetic operations.\n\nQuipus were mainly used for bookkeeping, but they also served as calendars.</item>
        <item>Computers do not necessarily have to be electronic devices. Any system that can map basic logical functions such as NOT, OR, AND is at least theoretically capable of performing all the tasks of a computer.\n\nThese can be mechanical structures made of ropes and pulleys, or a card game with appropriate rules, or redstone circuits in Minecraft. Even the cellular patterns in Conway\'s Game Of Life can map a digital computer - but you need a really, really huge playing field for that.</item>
        <item>The term “electronic” comes from the ancient Greek word ἤλεκτρον (“electron”), which means “amber”. This is actually a fossilised resin that is used as jewellery.\n\nIn contrast, “algorithm” is a word that looks very Greek, but is not. Around 800, the important mathematician Al-Khwarizmi lived in Baghdad, whose works were also translated into Latin. His name was distorted into “Algoritmi”, and this term has stuck.</item>
        <item>The word ‘cyber’ originally comes from seafaring. The ‘cybernator’ (or ‘gubernator’, from the Greek word κυβερνήτης) is the helmsman of a ship. In French, the helm is therefore called ‘gouvernail’. The word ‘governor’ also comes from ‘gubernator’, and therefore shares its origin with ‘cyber’.</item>
        <item>In the INTERCAL programming language, there is - among other absurd instructions - the PLEASE command. It does nothing, but if you don\'t use it often enough, the compiler is annoyed and terminates with an error message.\n\nYou must not write PLEASE too often, however, because then the compiler thinks that you are making fun of it and responds with E099 PROGRAMMER IS OVERLY POLITE.</item>
        <item>In this game, how are the “unwanted chips” placed? Their number is not exactly predetermined, but it is not completely random either.\n\nIt works roughly like this: A target difficulty level is determined for each level. The chips have a value depending on how annoying they are — for example, NOP has 0.5 and DUP 2.0. In addition, the length of the path that the attackers have to travel to the CPU is included in the difficulty (short paths with few slots are considered more difficult).\n\nFor each level, as many chips are placed at random until the specified difficulty is reached. The target difficulty naturally increases as the level increases. On the other hand, each level of Jack Kilby lowers it by 1, meaning that Kilby removes an average of two NOPs or one ADD or half a DUP.</item>
        <item>How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nNone. It\'s a hardware problem.</item>
        <item>Our word “robot” goes back to the Czech “robota”, which means “labour”. It was first used in 1920 in the theatre play “R.U.R.” by Karel Čapek.\n\nThe actual inventor of the word is Karel\'s brother Josef Čapek, an important writer, painter, graphic artist and photographer. The Čapek brothers had a significant influence on cultural and political life in Czechoslovakia between the world wars.\n\nJosef Čapek was arrested in 1939 for criticising National Socialism and murdered in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.</item>
        <item>In the game settings you can change the stage numbers to hexadecimal.</item>
        <item>In Anglo-American server rooms, there used to be warning notices that were written in a kind of pseudo-German and were intended as humorous parodies. There were very similar signs in German-speaking countries, but here, consequently, in pseudo-English.\nOne of the many versions read:\n\nACHTUNG!\n\nALLES TURISTEN UND NONTEKNISCHEN LOOKENSPEEPERS!\nDAS KOMPUTERMASCHINE IST NICHT FÜR DER GEFINGERPOKEN UND MITTENGRABEN! ODERWISE IST EASY TO SCHNAPPEN DER SPRINGENWERK, BLOWENFUSEN UND POPPENCORKEN MIT SPITZENSPARKEN. IST NICHT FÜR GEWERKEN BEI DUMMKOPFEN. DER RUBBERNECKEN SIGHTSEEREN KEEPEN DAS COTTONPICKEN HÄNDER IN DAS POCKETS MUSS. ZO RELAXEN UND WATSCHEN DER BLINKENLIGHTS.</item>
        <item>The first programmable desktop calculator came from Ivrea in Italy. At a time when computers were filling entire gymnasiums, the Olivetti company launched the “Programma 101”, which was a fully-fledged computer in the modern sense - even if it looked more like a commercial calculator.\n\nEven earlier was the “Mathatron” from Mathatronics. The exterior of this machine makes a somewhat tinkered impression, and it is not clear whether it was ever sold in large numbers. It also lacked an important feature that the “Programma 101” had: a magnetic card reader that allowed programmes to be saved and loaded.\n\nBoth machines were also revolutionary in that they could be operated using normal mathematical expressions and did not require expert knowledge of machine language.</item>
        <item>The first American computer, ENIAC, was programmed by a team of six high-calibre specialists - all of whom were women. For a long time, their achievements went virtually unrecognised. Only recently has there been an interest in the influence that these women had on the development of computer science.\n\nTheir names are Frances Spence, Betty Holberton, Ruth Teitelbaum, Kathleen Antonelli, Marlyn Meltzer and Jean Bartik.</item>
        <item>Instead of the hexadecimal system, computers can also work internally with ‘normal’ decimal numbers. A decimal digit from 0 to 9 is then coded in four bits, and the six superfluous combinations (A to F) are not used. This representation is called BCD (binary coded decimal) and has the advantage that a memory dump can be read in the familiar number system.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages. Around a third of the memory space is wasted and all logic and arithmetic operations become significantly more complicated and require more circuits. The BCD representation is therefore practically no longer used today.</item>

    <string name="shannon">Claude Elwood Shannon is considered the founder of information theory and one of the fathers of the information age. One of his major achievements was to transfer the mathematical theory of Boolean algebra to real circuits, thereby making modern digital computers possible. \n\nShannon developed the concept of information and entropy in messages, made important contributions to cryptography, and worked on artificial intelligence. Among other things, he described a programme for playing chess and constructed a mechanical mouse that could find its own way through a maze.  </string>
    <string name="boole">The achievement of George Boole Jr. lies in the fact that he formalised the concepts of logic and thus made them part of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the basis for the internal functioning of all modern computers.\n\nBoole was the son of a shoemaker and never attended any school other than primary school. He taught himself maths, Latin and Greek, French and German.</string>
    <string name="diffie">Together with Martin Hellmann, Bailey Whitfield Diffie developed the DH key exchange between two parties named after the two of them. They thus created an essential prerequisite for secure connections over the Internet.\n\nDiffie is also concerned about social issues of cryptography. He is a staunch advocate of the right to privacy.</string>
    <string name="conway">John Horton Conway is best known for the invention of Conway\'s Game Of Life, a cellular automaton that generates complex living patterns on a computer screen.

This way of combining memory, arithmetic unit and program control to create a freely programmable machine was largely developed by John von Neumann, who is considered one of the fathers of computer science. He was a brilliant mathematician who, among other things, laid the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, but also decisively advanced game theory. He was also a highly intelligent and witty person and a real party animal.\n\nThe darker side of von Neumann´s life is his contributions to military research and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction."</string>
