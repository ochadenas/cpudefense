New features:
- When playing the first time in "endless", 4 coins are granted for free to help get things going.

Bug fixes:
- If a stage in "endless" mode cannot be loaded, a new stage layout is generated.
- Chips created by von Neumann with level 2 or higher now have the correct value. When selling these chips, the refund is halved.
- Heroes that are active are always visible now, even if their prerequisites are no longer met.
- The number of available coins were not saved if a stage was not finished.
- Chips with level < 1 are removed at the beginning of a stage.

Miscellaneous:
- The additional chips created by the game (both helpful and unwanted) are recreated every time the level is played.
- Turing's biography now mentions that the Enigma was initially broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau.
