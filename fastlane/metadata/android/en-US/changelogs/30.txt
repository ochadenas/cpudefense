New Features:
- new hero: Claude Chappe
- Clearer design for buying and selling chips
- Chips now choose their target intelligently (with more than one attacker in range)
- Added an easter egg

Bugfixes:
- No new "endless" stages were available in the level selector beyond level 28.
- Heat generation and damage corrected and adjusted
- Fixed yet another bug when resuming the game

Miscellaneous:
- Changes in "endless" stage generation. Difficulty of the stage layout increases with the level. Impossible configurations are avoided.
- Changed the order of some levels in "normal" mode to make the difficulty progress more consistently.
