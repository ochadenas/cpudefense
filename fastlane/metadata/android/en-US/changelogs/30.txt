New Features:
    new hero: Claude Chappe
    Clearer design for buying and selling chips
    Chips now choose their target intelligently (with more than one attacker in range)
    Added an easter egg

Bugfixes:
    No new "endless" stages were available in the level selector beyond level 28.
    Heat generation and damage corrected and adjusted
    Fixed yet another bug when resuming the game

Miscellaneous:
    Changes in "endless" stage generation. Difficulty of the stage layout increases with the level. Impossible configurations are avoided.
    Changed the order of some levels in "normal" mode to make the difficulty progress more consistently.
